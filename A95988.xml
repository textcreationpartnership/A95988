            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen God, by his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, had diſſolved the late Parlament and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of State, the 20 of <hi>April,</hi> 1653; and moſt of thoſe Honorable Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Council, and Parlament (to whom I made formerly my humble Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes in the behalf of the State, againſt ſeveral Prize-ſhips and Silver, depending the 20 <hi>December,</hi> 1652, in the Court of Admiraltie) ceaſing from their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick emploiments, and reduced into the condition of private perſons; It pleaſed
<pb facs="tcp:170631:6"/> God to put it into my heart, to make my addreſſes to Col. <hi>Weeton,</hi> and Lievtenant Col. <hi>Joice,</hi> whom I had obſerved in all their actions to bee publick ſpirited men, and ſuch as daily ſought the honor and welfare of the Common-wealth.</p>
            <p>When I had acquainted them with my buſineſs, and how far I had proceeded in the Court of Admiraltie, and the preſent condition and poſture of the Common-wealth's Silver-priſes, and other affairs in that Court: They were pleaſed, when they underſtood my deſires, freely to preſent the ſtate of this weightie affair unto your Honors, deſiring your care of the buſineſs, even ſo far as your Honors ſaw it did conduce to the profit, ſafetie, and honor of the Common-wealth: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I made my humble addreſſes to your Honors; Major General <hi>Harriſon</hi> beeing pleaſed to give mee thanks for my pains and care I had taken about the ſtaying the Prize-Silver and Ships; and Collonel <hi>Bennet</hi> and Col. <hi>Jones</hi> ſending for mee, upon the Lievtenant of the Tower's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation to them about mee, They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired mee to give them informations for the carrying on the buſineſs of the Silver Prizes, and that I ſhould ſet down ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral rules for the managing the Coining
<pb facs="tcp:170631:6"/> of the ſilver for the State's profit, and for keeping an account of all the particular parcels, which I did, and delivered it to Col. <hi>Jones,</hi> and Col. <hi>Bennet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Major General <hi>Desborow</hi> procured mee a new Warrant from the Council of State: theſe great favors of your Honors, for giving mee encouragement to proceed in this buſineſs of the Prize-ſhips and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, I humbly conceiv, was onely in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the ſervice and proſperitie of the Common-wealth, and your love to Juſtice, that every one ſhould have his right.</p>
            <p>May it pleaſ your Honors! The Court of Admiraltie, in time of VVar, is like a private Poſtern to a ſtrong Caſtle that is beſieged; the paſſage is narrow, you can com in but one by one; but if the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon neglect to put a Sentinel at that door, that little Poſtern ſhall, in ſhort time, through the vigilancie of the Adverſaries, let in ſo many enemies, that the Caſtle will bee taken.</p>
            <p>Your Court of Admiraltie is a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Back-door of the Common-wealth; if the State watch not carefully, to ſee what goe's, and to have a good account of what Prizes com in, either for the State, or for private men of VVar.</p>
            <p>May it pleaſ your Honors! there is
<pb facs="tcp:170631:7"/> a great deal of difference between the judgment of any Court of Juſtice in <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> which are between man and man, and the Judgments and Acts of a Court of Admiraltie for maritime cauſes; for if an error in judgment, or any undue practices in the proceedings of the Chancerie, Upper-Beuch, Common-Pleas, and Checquer doth fall out; if it bee for the State, the Common-wealth may have a review, and trie their Title again: and the like it is between partie and partie, if they pleaſ: the Lands re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, the people are here to give a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponſ to any ſuch actions. But your Court of Admiraltie hath ſuch a Poſtern door, called, the <hi>Sea,</hi> that <hi>an error in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there, is a damage irreparable,</hi> in this conjuncture of time; for the Ships and Merchandize may bee, and have been, in your enemie's power, to bee imploied againſt you in 40 hours after, as in caſe of ſeveral Ships diſcharged the Court of Admiraltie.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Poſtern</hi> of your <hi>Court of Admiral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie</hi> was made ſo wide, by the induſtrie of ſeveral Merchants: and no doubt but it was by means of monie, that will cut through the <hi>Pirenean</hi> mountains, that twelv Ships paſſed out of the Court of Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raltie
<pb facs="tcp:170631:7"/> at one time, the 17 of <hi>November,</hi> 1652; and ſeven Ships the 19 <hi>Nov.</hi> and five the 16 <hi>Dec.</hi> 1652. &amp; 4 Ships 18 <hi>Dec.</hi> 1652: quick judgments in ſuch weightie buſineſſes; whereas the ſafetie of the Common-wealth, and every particular perſon, was concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have every Prize-ſhip ſtrictly exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined before their Diſcharge; and this was don after they were brought as Prize, at a vaſt charge of your Fleet and loſs of blood; <hi>a ſad thing to think,</hi> that the State's buſineſs ſhould bee ſo managed.</p>
            <p>May it pleaſ your Honors! about the 16 <hi>December,</hi> 1652, ſeventeen Ships were to bee diſcharged by the Court of Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raltie, conteining 3400 Tuns; all laden with rich Commodities, and ſilver, had not I com into the Court of Admiraltie, and proteſted againſt the Deliverie of them: as appear's on Record in the ſaid Court; for my doing thereof I had a verbal VVarrant from the Committee of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Affairs. If you will bee pleaſed to enquire what became of many of theſe Ships ſo diſcharged, this Narrative fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing will acquaint you: Som of them went to <hi>Holland,</hi> Captain <hi>Biſhop</hi>'s Letters from <hi>Holland</hi> will tell you the ſame of many of theſe Ships.</p>
            <p>May it pleaſ your Honors! The Court
<pb facs="tcp:170631:8"/> of Admiraltie was, about <hi>Christ-tide</hi> laſt, ruled by three men, of different affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: <hi>One,</hi> that knew much of the Law, and the practice of that Court, which hee did daily ſhew openly; but it was in that waie of bitterneſs againſt the State's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in their ſeveral Prizes, that no Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel at the Bar ſaid half ſo much for their Clients, as hee, beeing a Judg, declared againſt the Common-wealth's Title about ſom of the Prizes, and Silver. The <hi>Other</hi> juſt, and would have been glad to have don the Common-wealth's buſineſs, but that hee was not grounded in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding of that Court. A <hi>Third</hi> grown ſuddenly rich, by the common rule that all Judges that grow ſuddenly rich, muſt walk by.</p>
            <p>May it pleaſ your Honors! When I was firſt commanded by the Council of State to attend this buſineſs, about the Prize-ſilver, I ſaw ſo much in theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons &amp; their practice, and ſom of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of that Court, at the firſt entrance into the Court about this buſineſs of my Proteſt, that I was ſtartled and troubled to conſider, what a buſineſs I had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken to the Committee of Forreign Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs.</p>
            <p>But I put on a Reſolution, by God's Aſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
<pb facs="tcp:170631:8"/> not to bee worded out of this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, but to wade through it; for that the ſafetie of the whole Nation was at the Stake, in that conjuncture of time, the <hi>Hollanders</hi> beeing at that time in the <hi>Downs.</hi> And to terrifie mee, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter mee from proceeding to do you this ſervice; when I ſeriouſly conſidered of the buſineſs, I had <hi>firſt</hi> the Merchants ready to load mee with actions, if I could not have proved my Allegations. <hi>Secondly</hi> I had publick Miniſters, that would have taken away my life as an Incendiarie, if I could not have proved, there was Silver belonging to the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> in the Ships, <hi>Sampſon, Salvador,</hi> and <hi>George,</hi> which I ſtaied. And <hi>thirdly,</hi> had theſe Prizes been cleared, I had many of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of State would have ſent mee back to my Old Lodging in the Tower. <hi>Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> I had an enraged companie of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors and Proctors, and ſuch things, whoſe Trade I diſcovered, and was reſolved, by God's aſsiſtance, to ſpoil for the time to com; and indeed I had ſo many obſtacles to conteſt with, as would have ſtartled a thouſand men.</p>
            <p>Againſt this, I ſet the <hi>Safetie of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and <hi>reſtoring mee to my Estate:</hi> and that I ſhould convince mine enemies that they
<pb facs="tcp:170631:9"/> had don ill in oppreſsing mee, when they ſee both what I could and would venture to do for my Countrie's ſervice; and the world ſhould ſee, that I would not fear the face of any to unmask theſe frauds: And I hope the Juſtice and VViſdom of Parlament, will make ſtrict laws and rules for the future, to prevent ſuch abuſes as have been notoriouſly practiſed by many in that Court; and that the State will keep good Sentinels and watchmen for the future, both to examine all papers, Bills of Lading, and the Regiſters and all the Examiners, and other proceedings in that Court.</p>
            <p>It is not one or two of the ableſt men that can bee found in this Nation can do this buſineſs in the Admiraltie duly as it ſhould bee don: If I bee commanded, and have a moderate allowance, I will give the State a good account for the time to com.</p>
            <p>And at this preſent time the Prizes are many, and ſomtimes a man may light on a Letter, a Paper, or ſheet of Account, that may bee worth to the State a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand pounds: and there are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets in the expounding of Merchant's Letters, (that are not eaſily diſcovered) Accounts, and Bills of Lading, Purſer's
<pb facs="tcp:170631:9"/> Books; and will take up ſeveral knowing men's time to underſtand: a ſtrict eie will improve the State's Intereſt much; and if the State will have this buſineſs well don, it muſt bee well paid for; for ſmall fees and penſions, where great truſts are, make's the Divel ſuggeſt invitations to take Bribes; and where a man muſt laie out two or three hundred pounds, or more, for his intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, boat-hire, and meſſengers, (and without this your buſineſs cannot bee well don) and if your Officer ſhall not have much more a year from the State for his yearly Fees in this buſineſs; this, I believ, hath made ſom to take up the temptation, and to make them finde out waies to help themſelvs, ſeeing the State will not paie them well for their pains, get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting more in an hour by delivering a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, or concealing it, than the State will allow them for ſeven years Salarie. If I would have driven this Trade to have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traied my truſt, I needed not have asked the State a pennie: I could have had my <hi>eleven thouſand pound,</hi> without Petitioning for it. I have good reaſon to believ this is, and hath been acted by ſom: I would wiſh to mend it for the future, leaſt this fire burſt out, and conſume them before
<pb facs="tcp:170631:10"/> they bee aware of it: I have given ſom notice of it, if God give them grace to prevent it for the future; for elſ at one time or other it will burſt out. If I have proof of it, I ſhall not ſpare him or them, when I am emploied by the State.</p>
            <p>May it pleaſ your Honors! I diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the frauds of the Merchants, and others, in laboring to deceiv the State of their Prize-ſilver. But it was my Lord <hi>Bradſhaw,</hi> who, by his power, intereſt, and influence in the late Council of State, and his profound experience and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that cauſed the <hi>imbargo</hi> of the Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to bee made: and what benefit and Treaſure doth com into the Common-wealth by the Silver-prizes. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, I humbly ſay, ow's the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marie Remembrance thereof to his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and vigilancie in this weightie bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs: For when I brought him firſt my Papers, thoſe of the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
               <hi>December,</hi> 1652. And after other Papers, hee preſently up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his diligent reading of them, found out the fraud, as to his particular judgment, and asked mee many other Queſtions then I had writen; which ſatisfied him, and that made his Honor preſs ſo hard in this buſineſs againſt thoſe that oppoſed mee at
<pb facs="tcp:170631:10"/> the Council of State for my proſecution thereof; and to ſee that I ſhould not bee oppreſſed for doing the State this ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
            <p>For at one time in the Council of State, it was at a ſtanding-water, whether I ſhould ſhoot Bridg, and ſo go back to the Tower, where I had been formerly laid up, by the power of malitious and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til men, who made many of the late Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lament-men their inſtruments to keep mee in the Tower, upon pretence that I was a malignant, that ſo I ſhould not diſcover the neſt of Tranſporters of Gold and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; which I then was Ordered by the Parlament to do: and there is about twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie Orders of Parlament and Committees, for the bringing in the Act for the diſcoverie of the ſame, and the Act twice read in the late Parlament; and an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for the finiſhing the Act againſt the Tranſporters of Gold, about 14 <hi>April</hi> laſt, was appointed in the Parlament.</p>
            <p>May it pleaſ your Honors! my Lord <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> told mee; about <hi>Chriſt-tide</hi> laſt, before <hi>Tho. Weſtroop</hi> Eſquire, that there was ſom of the Council would, if they could, hang mee for ſtaying this Silver; which doing of mine, as hee conceived,
<pb facs="tcp:170631:11"/> was a great and good ſervice to the Common-wealth; but to the uttermoſt of his power hee would ſee they ſhould not oppreſs mee: So that the State ow's his Lordſhip for that benefit they receiv by the Prize-ſilver, and I ow my liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to his juſtice and goodneſs, that would engage himſelf in this buſineſs, to ſee I ſhould not bee oppreſſed for my doing this ſervice for the Common-wealth. I humbly wiſh, for the ſafetie of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, wee had more States-men of his profound judgment, vigilancie and courage.</p>
            <p>The God of heaven proſper your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors in all you take in hand; that ſo you may bee a bleſsing to this Nation in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral; that as God hath choſen you from thouſands of your Brethren to do mightie things, and wonderful in the eies of this Generation, both at home and abroad; ſo hee would out of his infinite mercies keep your hearts upright, that no world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proſperitie make you forget God's infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite mercies to you and yours; but that you may, all the daies of your life remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber your deliverances in the daies of bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, when you jeoparded your lives for the freedom of this Nation: no doubt God
<pb facs="tcp:170631:11"/> heard your vows, and exſpect's your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances for the good of this Nation.</p>
            <p>May it pleaſ your Honors! This Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative I humbly preſent you, is the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masking of a cunning and dangerous plot againſt the Parlament, tending to the ruine and deſtruction of every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Member of this Nation.</p>
            <p>When I was firſt engaged in making my diſcoverie, I met with many Waſps that did ſting mee, and venemous Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; but by the good guidance of God, the State hath plucked out ſom of their teeth; others will ſtorm to ſee theſe Truths diſcovered and laid open to your Honors. I am a moſt humble ſuiter to the Parlament and your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors for your protection and countenance in the doing this ſervice to the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>God bleſs and proſper all the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels and undertakings of Your Honors, and every particular Member of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Parlament; that no force or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination of forreign or home-born Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors may undermine them; that they beeing delivered from their enemies both at home and abroad, may never forget God's great mercies, that they may bee nurſing fathers of this Nation, that they may bee tender
<pb facs="tcp:170631:12"/> and merciful to the poor and diſtreſſed, that they bee builders up of our breaches, and that they carefully cheriſh Arts and Manufactures for the ſetting all the poor of this Nation a Work, that all the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of this life may bee beſtowed on them. And as God hath raiſed them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove their brethren, ſo that hee would bee pleaſed to raiſ them all to reign with his Son for ever; it beeing that which is promiſed thoſe that rule well here, ſhall reign with him eternally in the heavens: and this ſhall bee the praier of</p>
